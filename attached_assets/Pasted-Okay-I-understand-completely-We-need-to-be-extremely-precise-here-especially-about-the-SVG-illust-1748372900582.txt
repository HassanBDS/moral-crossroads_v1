Okay, I understand completely. We need to be extremely precise here, especially about the SVG illustrations and their dynamic behavior. The core challenge is achieving the visual fidelity and animation you desire, and you're willing to explore different technologies if necessary for that "visual appealing result."

Here is the refined prompt for Replit, focusing on the critical SVG characters, their creation, and the detailed animation sequence. I will ensure it's structured to guide Replit towards a successful and observable outcome, even if it requires a different underlying tech stack.

REPLIT PROMPT: FINAL REBUILD - DYNAMIC SVG TROLLEY PROBLEM QUIZ

Ultimate Goal: Create a fully functional, highly interactive, and visually faithful "Trolley Problem Quiz" web application. This application must feature dynamic, animated illustrations with custom-generated SVG characters (inspired by the given visual style), a custom "Al Boraq" train, and precise collision animations. The project aims for a polished neal.fun aesthetic, but with your unique touches.

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL DIRECTIVES (Please Read Carefully):

SVG Character Creation: For all characters (people, animals, etc.) within the scenes, you MUST create and render them as scalable SVG vector graphics directly in the code or via a dynamic SVG rendering approach. Do NOT use the provided JPEG images as <img> tags in the final output. The JPEGs are for visual inspiration only for the style of the characters.

The characters should resemble the "bandaged" or "mummy-like" line-art style from the original neal.fun game.

When new characters are introduced (e.g., a cat, a lobster, a "fat man"), you MUST create corresponding SVG representations for them in this style.

Groups of characters (e.g., 5 people, 4 people) should be rendered as clustered/stacked groups within a single SVG or dynamically arranged closely, visually similar to the original neal.fun aesthetic, not as single figures in a straight line.

Trolley Animation & Impact (Precise Sequence): The animation of the trolley and its interaction with characters is paramount.

Initial State: The scene loads with the custom Al Boraq trolley, the track (with its diversion), all characters/objects, and the user's character (based on gender choice) all correctly positioned.

User Choice: When a choice button is clicked:

The user's character visually changes to a "pulling lever" pose (SVG swap).

A clear status text appears (e.g., "Trolley moving...").

The Al Boraq trolley begins to animate smoothly along the chosen track (either the main track or the diverted track).

Collision Point: The trolley's animation MUST physically reach the exact location of the targeted character(s) on the track.

Impact Effect: At the moment of collision, the targeted character(s) (people, animals, etc.) MUST be instantly replaced by their "splatted" SVG version (or disappear/turn into a splat effect). This visual change should occur at the impact location.

Trolley Continues: The trolley then continues its movement forward along the track, smoothly passing the impact point, and eventually moves off-screen or clearly beyond the scene.

Saved Characters: Any characters/objects on the non-chosen track remain visible and unaffected.

Results Display: After the entire animation sequence completes, the voting results section appears.

Technology Stack Flexibility: I prioritize a fully functional, visually rich, and animated result. If this requires using a modern JavaScript framework (like React, Vue) or a specific SVG/animation library, that is acceptable, provided the code is well-structured and understandable for learning purposes. If a framework is chosen, ensure clear component separation.

Project Structure:

Root Directory:

index.html (Single main HTML file)

css/ (Contains style.css, responsive.css)

js/ (Contains main.js, scenarios.js, voting.js)

assets/

svgs/ (This directory will contain the generated/created SVG files for characters, train, track, and effects like splats.)

fonts/ (Contains custom font files like Composition-Regular.woff2, JustSquash.woff2, Roboto-Medium.woff2.)

Core Functionality & UI/UX Requirements:

Initial Setup Screen:

Application starts with a dedicated setup screen.

Allows optional character name input.

Requires selection of character gender (Male, Female, Non-Binary) via radio buttons.

"Start Game" button initiates the main game (disabled until gender is chosen).

Header Design:

Main Logo: "BORAQ RAILWAY" text (or a simple SVG placeholder) in a styled box in the top-left.

Main Headline: "Absurd Trolley Problems" using the JustSquash font, centrally placed within a prominent, black-bordered box with a subtle box-shadow.

Level Indicator: Current level (e.g., "Level 1: Basic Dilemma") clearly displayed. Green circular badge for the level number, and the level title in a separate, stylized, black-bordered box using Roboto-Medium font.

Optional: "ðŸ§  Think carefully" text in the top-right.

Problem Description Area:

Green-bordered box with a green circular "dot" on the top-left.

Problem text loads exactly from scenarios.js (including the optional user name).

Dilemma choices formatted as a multi-line bulleted list (using <ul><li> with custom ::before styles for bullets).

Choice Buttons:

Implement "fancy box" styling: distinct borders, noticeable box-shadows, subtle hover effects.

Clear visual change when a button is selected.

Buttons are disabled after a choice is made.

Button text dynamically updates based on the scenario's choices (e.g., "Pull the lever", "Push the person", "Accept the bribe").

Voting Statistics Area:

Appears after the trolley animation completes.

Displays only percentages (e.g., "X% agree with you, Y% disagree"). No total vote count.

Visual progress bars for "Agree" (green gradient) and "Disagree" (red gradient), with percentages overlaid.

"Next â†’" button appears to advance the scenario.

Scenario Data (js/scenarios.js):

Define data for at least 2-3 initial scenarios (e.g., "Basic Dilemma", "Four People", "The Fat Person").

Each scenario object must define problem text, choices, and illustration details.

The illustration must clearly specify which SVG files to load for initial, chosen-path-outcome, and other-path-outcome states (e.g., one-guy.svg, one-guy-splat.svg, one-guy-safe.svg, fat-man.svg, fat-man-splat.svg, etc.), and the you_char_position_class.

Asset Handling:

Crucial: All character and train illustrations in assets/svgs/ must be generated/created as SVG code by Replit, matching the described style (line-art, "mummy-like" characters, clustered groups) and the Al Boraq train. They should not be direct JPEG embeds.

The fonts (Composition-Regular.woff2, JustSquash.woff2, Roboto-Medium.woff2) are expected in assets/fonts/.

After building the project, please confirm that all these requirements have been met, paying particular attention to the dynamic SVG illustrations, character creation style, grouping, and the precise animation sequence upon choice. Provide a brief explanation of the technology chosen and why it was deemed best for this visual fidelity.
